The `tqdm` library in Python is used for creating progress bars in loops and other iterable structures. Its names
stands for `taqaddum` which means `progress` in Arabic. The ideas is to give users a clear visual indicator of how
much of a task has been completed and how much is remaining.

## Key Features of tqdm:
- Progress Bars in Loops: It wraps around any iterable (like a for loop), showing the progress percentage, elapsed time, estimated remaining time, and other stats. 
- Customizable: You can change the description, bar format, color, etc., to fit the requirements of your application.
- Nesting Progress Bars: You can have multiple nested progress bars to track more complex processes.
- Dynamic Length Iterables: It works even when the length of the iterable is unknown.
- File Transfers: It can be used to show progress in operations such as file reading or downloading data.
- Multi-threading and Multi-processing Support: You can use tqdm in multi-threaded or multi-processing scenarios with ease.
