Using global names in large-scale software projects can lead to conflicts, especially when multiple class libraries are in operation. C++ provides for the use of namespaces in order to avoid naming conflicts with global identifiers. Within a namespace, you can use identifiers without needing to check whether they have been defined previously in an area outside of the namespace. Thus, the global scope is subdivided into isolated parts. A normal namespace is identified by a name preceded by the namespace keyword. The elements that belong to the namespace are then declared within braces.
